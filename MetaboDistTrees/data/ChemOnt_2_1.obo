Without vitamin K, blood coagulation is seriously impaired, and uncontrolled bleeding occurs. Low levels of vitamin K also weaken bones and promote calcification of arteries and other soft tissues (Wikipedia).

comment: In humans, Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) and Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT2) also catalyze the reaction: Acyl-CoA + retinol = CoA + retinyl ester. They function as the major acyl-CoA retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) in the skin, where it acts to maintain retinoid homeostasis and prevent retinoid toxicity leading to skin and hair disorders. (UniProt)\nIn humans, Acyl-CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 2 (AWAT2) may also have 2-acylglycerol O-acyltransferase (MGAT) and acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) activities, to catalyze the synthesis of diacylglycerols and retinyl esters; however this activity is unclear in vivo.

comment: They are isolated originally from culture extracts of Aspergillus ochraceus, and subsequently from other Aspergillus spp. and from Penicullium viridicatum. The most important and most toxic ochratoxin found naturally in food is ochratoxin A (OTA). The only other ochratoxin found in food is ochratoxin B, which is rare and much less toxic. Other structurally related ochratoxins include ochratoxin C, alpha and beta. These have been isolated from fungal cultures, but are not normally found in foods.

comment: Nature uses sulfation of endogenous and exogenous molecules mainly to avoid potential toxicity. The growing importance of natural sulfated molecules, as modulators of a number of physiological and pathological processes, has inspired the synthesis of non-natural sulfated scaffolds. Until the 1990s,the synthesis of sulfated small molecules was almost restricted to derivatives of flavonoids and aimed mainly at structure elucidation and plant biosynthesis studies. Currently, the synthesis of this type of compounds concerns structurally diverse scaffolds and is aimed at the development of potential drugs and/or exploitation of the biological effects of sulfated metabolites. Some important hit compounds are emerging from sulfated flavonoids and other polyphenols mainly as anticoagulant and antiviral agents.

name: Organolead compounds
def: "Compounds containing bond between a carbon atom and a lead atom." []
comment: Organic lead is fat soluble and can be absorbed through the skin. Lead interferes with numerous physiological processes. In the haeme biosynthetic pathway, it inhibits delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (also known as porphobilinogen synthase), probably through its high affinity for the zinc-binding site in the enzyme. Lead inhibits pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase, resulting in accumulation of nucleotides, and subsequent haemolysis and anaemia. Renal manifestations of acute lead poisoning include glycosuria, aminoaciduria and phosphaturia. Exposure to lead is associated with cardiovascular effects and with changes in endocrine and immune functions. In humans, prenatal lead exposure is associated with an increased risk for minor malformations, low birth weight and reduced postnatal growth rate. The effect on postnatal growth rate is apparent only in those children with continuing postnatal lead exposure. Lead is neurotoxic.

It has been reported that some of its derivatives are used as inhibitors of protein kinases,blood platelet aggregation, bone metabolism improvers, anti-inflammatories, antifungal, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and anticancer agents. On the other hand, pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazines are also used as fluorescent and disperse dyes in dye chemistry[PMID24618512].
